<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>
Everyone can upload his/her film by following the application.

Documentaries have to be uploaded onto existing servers or directly to our webpage, therefore they can be accept or dismissed for the GlobalWebDoc page. Selection is employed only to avoid too many submissions portraying violence; our goal is to show films that focus on the progress of work in social movements.
